Here is a combined, short, and easy-to-read final note:

*   Number Theory foundations involve the Division Algorithm, Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), and Least Common Multiple (LCM).
*   Modular arithmetic deals with remainders, congruences, and solving linear congruences.
*   Bézout's Identity expresses the GCD of two numbers as their linear combination.
*   The Chinese Remainder Theorem helps solve systems of multiple linear congruences.
*   Euler's Totient Function counts positive integers relatively prime to a given number.
*   Fermat's Little Theorem and Euler's Theorem simplify calculations involving powers in modular arithmetic.
*   Permutations count arrangements where order matters, while combinations count selections where order does not.
*   The Pigeonhole Principle states that if items exceed containers, at least one container must hold multiple items.
*   Recursion defines sequences where each term depends on previous ones.
*   Graph Theory studies connections between points (vertices) and lines (edges).
*   Triangle geometry covers fundamental properties, special lines, and centers within triangles.
*   Classical geometry theorems like Ceva's and Menelaus' identify specific relationships in triangles.
*   Polynomial theory includes the relationship between roots and coefficients, such as Vieta’s formulas.
*   Classical inequalities like AM-GM and Cauchy-Schwarz are used to compare values.
