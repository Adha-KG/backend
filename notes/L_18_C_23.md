### Physics: Diffraction - Single-Slit, Double-Slit, and Multiple-Slit Patterns

### 1. Introduction to Diffraction

Diffraction is the phenomenon where waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through an opening. In academic settings, we analyze how light (as a wave) behaves when it encounters narrow slits.

*   **Conceptual Model:** A slit is considered to be made up of many tiny, equally spaced zones. Each zone acts as a source of coherent light waves, and their combined effect determines the total electric field and intensity observed on a screen.
*   **Key Parameters:**
    *   $\lambda$: Wavelength of light
    *   $\theta$: Angle from the center of the slit(s) to the observation point on the screen
    *   $L$ or $f$: Distance to the screen/focal length of the lens

### 2. Single-Slit Diffraction

This describes the pattern created when light passes through a single narrow opening of width '$a$'.

#### A. Theoretical Basis and Intensity

Waves from different points within the slit travel slightly different distances, leading to phase differences.
*   **Resultant Electric Field Amplitude ($E_R$):** The amplitude of the total electric field at a point on the screen is given by:
    $ E_R = E_M \frac{\sin \alpha}{\alpha} $
    *   Where $E_M$ is the maximum amplitude (at $\theta = 0$).
    *   **Phase Parameter ($\alpha$):** $\alpha = \frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}$. This parameter encapsulates the phase contributions due to the slit's width.
*   **Intensity Distribution:** The intensity ($I$) of light is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude:
    $ I = I_0 \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\alpha^2} $
    *   $I_0$ is the intensity at the central maximum ($\theta = 0$, where $\alpha = 0$).

#### B. Positions of Minima (Dark Fringes)

Minima occur where the intensity is zero ($\sin \alpha = 0$, but $\alpha \neq 0$).
*   **Condition for Minima:** $ a \sin \theta = m\lambda $
    *   Where $m = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \dots$ (excluding $m=0$, which is the central maximum).

#### C. Positions of Maxima (Bright Fringes)

*   **Central Maximum:** Occurs at $\theta = 0$ (where $\alpha = 0$). This is the brightest and widest fringe.
*   **Secondary Maxima:** These are less bright and occur at the roots of the transcendental equation: $ \tan \alpha = \alpha $
    *   Approximate values for the first few secondary maxima are $\alpha \approx 1.43 \pi$ and $\alpha \approx 2.46 \pi$.
    *   The intensity of these secondary maxima decreases rapidly as they move away from the central maximum.

#### D. Single-Slit Calculations & Examples

*   **Intensity Ratio:** The first secondary maxima (using $\alpha \approx 1.43\pi$) have an intensity of about $I/I_0 \approx 0.0496$ (or ~4.96%) of the central maximum's intensity.
    *   An approximation using $\alpha = 3\pi/2$ yields $I/I_0 \approx 0.045$ (or ~4.5%).
*   **Example: Fringe Positions and Width**
    *   For a wavelength $\lambda = 580 \text{ nm}$ and slit width $a = 0.300 \text{ mm}$, observed on a screen $L = 2.00 \text{ m}$ away:
        *   **Positions of First Dark Fringes ($m=\pm 1$):** $y_1 = \pm L \sin \theta \approx \pm L (\lambda/a) = \pm 3.87 \text{ mm}$.
        *   **Width of Central Bright Fringe:** This width is $2y_1 = 7.74 \text{ mm}$.

### 3. Double-Slit Diffraction

When light passes through two slits, the pattern is a combination of two phenomena:
1.  **Diffraction:** from each individual slit (governed by slit width '$a$').
2.  **Interference:** between the waves emerging from the two slits (governed by slit separation '$d$' between centers).

#### A. Intensity Distribution

The total intensity for a double-slit pattern is given by:
$ I = 4 I_0 \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\alpha^2} \cos^2 \beta $
*   Where:
    *   $\alpha = \frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}$ (the **diffraction factor** from a single slit)
    *   $\beta = \frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}$ (the **interference factor** between the two slits, where $d$ is the center-to-center slit separation).
*   **Pattern Characteristics:** The overall pattern consists of closely spaced bright interference fringes (from $\cos^2 \beta$) whose intensities are modulated by the broader single-slit diffraction envelope (from $\frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\alpha^2}$).

#### B. Limiting Cases

*   **Vanishingly Narrow Slits ($a \rightarrow 0$):**
    *   If slit width $a$ approaches zero, then $\alpha \rightarrow 0$, and $\frac{\sin \alpha}{\alpha} \rightarrow 1$.
    *   The pattern simplifies to $I = 4 I_0 \cos^2 \beta$, which is the pure **interference pattern** of two point sources.
*   **Slits Coincide ($d \rightarrow 0$):**
    *   If slit separation $d$ approaches zero, the two slits merge into a single, wider slit. Then $\beta \rightarrow 0$, and $\cos^2 \beta \rightarrow 1$.
    *   The pattern simplifies to $I = 4 I_0 \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\alpha^2}$, which is the **diffraction pattern** of a single slit of width $a$. (The factor of 4 accounts for the combined light from two slits).

#### C. Missing Orders (Diffraction and Interference Overlap)

A "missing order" occurs when an interference maximum perfectly aligns with a diffraction minimum, causing that bright interference fringe to be suppressed.
*   **Condition for Missing Orders:**
    *   Interference maxima occur at $d \sin \theta = n\lambda$ ($n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots$).
    *   Diffraction minima occur at $a \sin \theta = m\lambda$ ($m = \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots$).
    *   For an interference maximum ($n$) to be missing due to a diffraction minimum ($m$): $ \frac{d}{a} = \frac{n}{m} $
    *   The ratio $d/a$ is typically greater than 1, meaning interference fringes are narrower than diffraction lobes.
*   **Example:** If $d/a \approx 4$, then $n/m \approx 4$. The first missing order would be the 4th interference maximum ($n=4$) coinciding with the 1st diffraction minimum ($m=1$).

### 4. Multiple-Slit Diffraction (N Slits)

This extends the concept to $N$ parallel, equally wide ($a$) and equally spaced slits, with $d = a+b$ (where $b$ is the opaque region width) being the separation between adjacent slit centers.

#### A. Electric Field and Intensity

The total electric field from $N$ slits is derived by summing the individual slit fields, each phase-shifted by $\Phi = \frac{2\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}$.
*   **Total Electric Field ($E$):**
    $ E = E_M \frac{\sin \alpha}{\alpha} \frac{\sin (N\beta)}{\sin \beta} \sin [\omega t + \dots] $
    *   Where $E_M$ is the maximum amplitude, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are defined as before.
*   **Intensity Distribution:**
    $ I = I_0 \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\alpha^2} \frac{\sin^2 N\beta}{\sin^2 \beta} $
    *   This formula has two critical components:
        1.  **Single-slit Diffraction Factor:** $\frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\alpha^2}$ (modulates the overall intensity, forming an envelope).
        2.  **N-slit Interference Factor:** $\frac{\sin^2 N\beta}{\sin^2 \beta}$ (responsible for the sharp, bright interference peaks).

#### B. Characteristics and Special Cases

*   The overall pattern is an **N-slit interference pattern** modulated by a **single-slit diffraction envelope**.
*   **N=1 (Single Slit):**
    *   The interference factor $\frac{\sin^2 (1 \cdot \beta)}{\sin^2 \beta} = 1$.
    *   The intensity reduces to $I = I_0 \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\alpha^2}$, the single-slit formula.
*   **N=2 (Double Slit):**
    *   The interference factor $\frac{\sin^2 (2\beta)}{\sin^2 \beta} = \frac{(2 \sin \beta \cos \beta)^2}{\sin^2 \beta} = 4 \cos^2 \beta$.
    *   The intensity reduces to $I = 4 I_0 \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\alpha^2} \cos^2 \beta$, the double-slit formula.
