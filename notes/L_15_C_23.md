Here are the most important points on Interference of Waves:

*   **Interference** is when two or more coherent waves combine, redistributing their intensity in space.
*   **Coherent waves** have the same frequency and a constant phase relationship.
*   **Constructive interference** occurs when wave crests meet crests or troughs meet troughs, resulting in a stronger wave.
*   **Destructive interference** occurs when a crest meets a trough, resulting in a weaker or no wave.
*   **Young's Double-Slit Experiment** is a classic demonstration where two coherent light sources from slits create an interference pattern.
*   This experiment produces a visible pattern of bright (constructive) and dark (destructive) **fringes** on a screen.
*   For **bright fringes**, the path difference `d sin θ` must be an integer multiple of the wavelength (`mλ`).
*   For **dark fringes**, the path difference `d sin θ` must be a half-integer multiple of the wavelength (`(m + 1/2)λ`).
*   The **position of bright fringes** on a distant screen is given by `y_bright = (mλD) / d`.
*   The **spacing between adjacent fringes** is `Δy = λD/d`.
*   The **intensity of the interference pattern** at any point is `I = I_max cos^2(φ/2)`, where `φ` is the phase difference.
*   These principles allow the calculation of light properties like wavelength or specific positions within an interference pattern.
