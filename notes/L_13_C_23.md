Here are the most important points about waves:

*   **Diffraction** is when waves spread out after passing through a gap or around an obstacle, most evident when the gap size matches the wavelength.
*   **Interference** occurs when coherent waves (same frequency, constant phase) overlap, creating patterns of stronger (constructive) and weaker (destructive) waves.
*   **Polarization** applies only to transverse waves (e.g., light), where vibrations are limited to a specific plane; Polaroid sunglasses use this to reduce glare.
*   A **wave pulse** travels at a constant speed and maintains its shape, with its vertical position at any point and time given by `y(x, t) = f(x ± vt)`.
*   **Transverse waves on a string** are driven by restorative forces from tension, causing vertical simple harmonic motion.
*   The wave's speed and behavior on a string depend on its **mass per unit length ($\mu$)** and **tension ($T$)**.
*   The motion of transverse waves on a string is described by the **one-dimensional wave equation**: $\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}$.
*   In this wave equation, the **wave speed ($v$)** is determined by $v = \sqrt{T/\mu}$.
*   The **general solution** to the wave equation is `y(x, t) = F(x - vt) + G(x + vt)`.
*   This solution represents two disturbances: one moving in the positive `x` direction (`F`) and one in the negative `x` direction (`G`), both at speed `v`.
