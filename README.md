# Study Helper Pro

A modern FastAPI application built with Poetry for dependency management, Uvicorn as the ASGI server, and Ruff for code formatting and linting.

## 🚀 Features

- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs
- **Poetry**: Modern dependency management and packaging
- **Uvicorn**: Lightning-fast ASGI server
- **Ruff**: Ultra-fast Python linter and formatter
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated code quality checks
- **Pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+** (recommended: Python 3.11)
- **Poetry** - [Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)


## 🛠️ Local Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git    
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

### 3. Set up pre-commit hooks
```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### 4. Run the application
```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at:
- **Application**: http://localhost:8000
- **Interactive API docs (Swagger)**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Alternative API docs (ReDoc)**: http://localhost:8000/redoc


## 🔍 Code Quality


### Pre-commit Hooks


```bash
# Manually run pre-commit on all files
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
This repo has a pre-commit that formats the files before committing. You may also want to have vscode extension for a better development experience, you can install the [Ruff extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) and enable "Format on Save" in your editor settings.
